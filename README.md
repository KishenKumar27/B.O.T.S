# Battle of the Sexes (B.O.T.S)

This project is an implementation of the Battle of the Sexes (B.O.T.S) game, developed as part of an assignment for the PSP course. The game is designed to simulate a game between two players where strategy, decision-making, and randomness are key components.

## Project Structure

The project is currently in the initial setup phase and contains the following files:

### Root Directory
- **Assignment.pdf**: The assignment description file outlining the requirements and objectives of the project.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting it up.

  
### Starter Kit Folder (`Starter Kit-20200615T083047Z-001/Starter Kit`)
- **Bots (2).py**: Python file for implementing logic related to the B.O.T.S game.
- **NEW.py**: Another Python file related to the B.O.T.S game (potentially a revised version).
- **PSP.py**: A Python file potentially dealing with game mechanics or utility functions for the B.O.T.S game.
- **Tutorial.py**: File likely containing guidance or tutorials related to the game or assignment.
- **psphelper.py**: A helper script, likely offering functions or utilities for the B.O.T.S game.
- **testing.py**: A testing script to verify the functionality of the game components.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional version of the Battle of the Sexes game, where two players compete by choosing strategies based on a series of rules. The game will incorporate various components like strategy selection, game logic, and player interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KishenKumar27/B.O.T.S.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   If there are any required dependencies (such as libraries), ensure they are installed by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Note: As of now, no requirements.txt file is present, but you can add any dependencies in the future.)

3. **Start development**:
   Begin the development of the main game logic, user interface, and any additional components needed to complete the game.

## Future Development
Currently, there is no main.py or game.py file in place. The next steps include:

- Implementing the core game logic in game.py.
- Creating a main.py file to initialize the game and handle user inputs.
- Writing additional functions for player interaction, game flow, and outcomes.
- Testing the functionality of the game logic using the existing testing.py script.
